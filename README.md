# Vibe coding on FBO One

**Creating and testing different new FBO One components**

_Episode 1: Filter chip_

Vibe coding here, using a variety of tools, from Figma to Cursor, from Builder.io to AI (cluade).

The purpose of these episodes is to design and recreate different UI custom components for the FBO One user experience, and then to share them with the rest of team for testing them and gathering feedback for further improvements.<br/>

In this first episode, I'm going to think and develop a custom _filter-chip_ for Parking slots selection, using a combination of MUI v6 components such as: <br/>

- Chip
- Badge
- Link
- Text field
- Checkbox
- Icon
- Button-icon

If you don't want to do all the Dev stuff, I prepared the table for you:
