# Vibe coding on FBO One [part1]

**Creating and testing different new FBO One components**

Vibe coding here, using a variety of tools, from Figma to Cursor, from Builder.io to AI (cluade).

I wanted to design and recreate in this first episode, different UI custom components for the FBO One user experience, and then to share them with the rest of team for testing them and gathering feedback for further improvements.
All of them based on React and MUI v6 components library.

The first of them it will be a complex custom filter chip for multiselection.
