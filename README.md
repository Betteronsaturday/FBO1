# Vibe coding on FBO One components

**Creating and testing different FBO One new components**

Vibe coding here, using a variety of tools, from Figma to Cursor, from Builder.io to AI (cluade).

I wanted to design and recreate different UI custom components for the FBO One users, and then to share them with the rest of them for testing them and gathering feedback for further improvements.
All of them based on React and MUI v6.

The first of them it will be a complex custom filter chip for multiselection.
